# mailman-admin-helper
A small Firefox web extension that adds some nice things for the mailman admin used by Mozilla.

## Improvements
- Modifies the admin database spam page and replaces the hard-to-click table-based form with 4 buttons: Accept, Accept & Whitelist, Discard, and Discard & Blacklist. This removes the ability to do things like Reject all the messages from an individual user, but I don't use those features. PRs welcome to add this back in.

## How to Install
You can find installable XPIs on the [releases page](https://github.com/Osmose/mailman-admin-helper/releases). Just click the link and Firefox will prompt you to install.
